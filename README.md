# Grad-based-Dim-Red-for-SER-using-Deep-Netw

This is the open source code of the paper **“GRADIENT-BASED DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION FOR SPEECH EMOTION RECOGNITION USING DEEP NETWORKS”**, accepted by ICASSP2024, including the data preprocessing and dimensionality reduction methods used in the paper. Since follow-up work is still in progress, this repository will not contain the processed data for the time being and is only used to help interested researchers reproduce the methods of the paper.
